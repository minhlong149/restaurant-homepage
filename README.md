# Webpack Concepts

## Entry

An entry point indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal dependency graph. Webpack will figure out which other modules and libraries that entry point depends on (directly and indirectly).

By default, its value is `./src/index.js`.

**webpack.config.js**

```
module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
};
```

## Output

The output property tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates and how to name these files. It defaults to `./dist/main.js` for the main output file and to the `./dist` folder for any other generated file.

**webpack.config.js**

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js',
  },
};
```

## Loaders

Out of the box, webpack only understands JavaScript and JSON files. Loaders allow webpack to process other types of files and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application and added to the dependency graph.

**webpack.config.js**

```
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }],
  },
};
```

## Plugins

While loaders are used to transform certain types of modules, plugins can be leveraged to perform a wider range of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.

In order to use a plugin, you need to `require()` it and add it to the `plugins` array. 

**webpack.config.js**

```
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const webpack = require('webpack'); //to access built-in plugins

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: './src/index.html'
      }),
  ],
};
```

## Mode

By setting the `mode` parameter to either `development`, `production` or `none`, you can enable webpack's built-in optimizations that correspond to each environment.

**webpack.config.js**

```
module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
};
```

# Getting Started

## Basic Setup

Initialize `npm`, install `webpack` locally, and install the `webpack-cli` (the tool used to run webpack on the command line) to the `node_modules` directory

```
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

## Creating a Bundle

Run `npx webpack`, which will take our script at `src/index.js` as the entry point, and will generate `dist/main.js` as the output.

## Using a Configuration

Given it's not particularly fun to run a local copy of webpack from the CLI, we can set up a little shortcut. Let's adjust our `package.json` by adding an npm script:

**package.json**

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack"
  }
}
```

Now the `npm run build` command can be used in place of the npx command we used earlier.

# Asset Management

## Loading CSS

In order to import a CSS file from within a JavaScript module, you need to install and add the `style-loader` and `css-loader` to your module configuration. This enables you to import `./style.css` into the file that depends on that styling. When that module is run, a `<style>` tag with the stringified CSS will be inserted into the `<head>` of your html file.

```
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
```

### sass-loader

```
npm install sass-loader sass --save-dev
```

> Since Sass implementations don't provide url rewriting, all linked assets must be relative to the output. [Thankfully there are a two solutions to this problem.](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/#problems-with-url)

## Loading Images

When you import MyImage from `./my-image.png`, that image will be processed and added to your output directory and the MyImage variable will contain the final url of that image after processing. When using the `css-loader`, as shown above, a similar process will occur for `url('./my-image.png')` within your CSS. The loader will recognize this is a local file, and replace the `./my-image.png` path with the final path to the image in your output directory.

## Loading Fonts

With the loader configured and fonts in place, you can incorporate them via an @font-face declaration. The local `url(...)` directive will be picked up by webpack, as it was with the image.

**webpack.config.js**

```
 module.exports = {
   module: {
     rules: [
       {
         test: /\.css$/i,
         use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
       },
       {
         test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
         type: 'asset/resource',
       },
      {
        test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/i,
        type: 'asset/resource',
      },
     ],
   },
 };
```

**src/index.js**

```
import './style.css';

function component() {
  const element = document.createElement('div');
  element.classList.add('hello');
  element.innerHTML = "Hello webpack";

  const myIcon = new Image();
  myIcon.src = require('./icon.png');
  element.appendChild(myIcon);

  return element;
}

document.body.appendChild(component());
```

**src/style.css**

```
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyFont';
  src:
    url('./my-font.woff1') format('woff1');
    url('./my-font.woff2') format('woff2'),
  font-weight: 600;
  font-style: normal;
}

.hello {
  color: red;
  font-family: 'MyFont';
  background: url('./icon.png');
}
```

# Output Management

## Setting up HtmlWebpackPlugin

Install the plugin and adjust the `webpack.config.js` file:

```
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```

**webpack.config.js**

```
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      title: 'Output Management',
    }),
  ],
 };
```

`HtmlWebpackPlugin` by default will generate its own index.html file, even though we already have one in the dist/ folder. This means that it will replace our index.html file with a newly generated one.

## Cleaning up the /dist folder

Webpack doesn't keep track of which files are actually in use by your project. In general it's good practice to clean the /dist folder before each build, so that only used files will be generated.

```
module.exports = {
  output: {
    clean: true,
  },
};
```

# Development

## Using source maps

If you bundle three source files (a.js, b.js, and c.js) into one bundle (bundle.js) and one of the source files contains an error, the stack trace will point to bundle.js. In order to make it easier to track down errors and warnings, JavaScript offers source maps, which map your compiled code back to your original source code. If an error originates from b.js, the source map will tell you exactly that.

**webpack.config.js**

```
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      title: 'Output Management',
      title: 'Development',
    }),
  ],
 };
```

## Using Watch Mode

You can instruct webpack to "watch" all files within your dependency graph for changes. If one of these files is updated, the code will be recompiled so you don't have to run the full build manually.

**package.json**

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "watch": "webpack --watch",
  }
}
```

Run `npm run watch` from the command line and see how webpack compiles your code. 

## Using webpack-dev-server

The `webpack-dev-server` provides you with a rudimentary web server and the ability to use live reloading.

```
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server
```

**webpack.config.js**

```
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    static: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, 'dist')
    },
  },
};
```

This tells `webpack-dev-server` to serve the files from the `dist` directory on `localhost:8080`.

**package.json**

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack serve --open",
  }
}
```

Now we can run `npm run start` from the command line and we will see our browser automatically loading up our page. If you now change any of the source files and save them, the web server will automatically reload after the code has been compiled.

## Enabling Hot Module Replacement

Hot Module Replacement (or HMR) is one of the most useful features for productivity. It allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime, without the need for a full refresh.

**webpack.config.js**

```
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    hot: true,
  },
};
```

You can also use the CLI to modify the webpack-dev-server configuration.

**package.json**

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack serve --hot-only",
  }
}
```

# Setup TypeScript

Install the TypeScript compiler and loader.

```
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
```

Then, let's configure webpack to handle TypeScript:

**webpack.config.js**

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js'],
  },
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

This will direct webpack to enter through `./index.ts`, load all `.ts` and `.tsx` files through the `ts-loader`, and output a `bundle.js` file in our current directory.

# Deploying a subfolder to GitHub Pages

1. Remove the `dist` directory from the projectâ€™s `.gitignore` file.
2. Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with your site)
```
git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"
```
3. Each time you re-build the project to a final release, use `subtree push` to send your subfolder to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

```
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```
